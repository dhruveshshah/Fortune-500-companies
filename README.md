# Fortune-500-companies
I have created draft visualizations with the pseudo data for the fortune 500 companies. I have chose scatter plot and box plot to examine relation between expenditure and profit for different companies. But 
before performing any analysis, addressing various discrepancies in the data is important. I have cleaned the data by treating the NA values, converting variables to different data types so that it can contribute to the analysis,imputing median and deriving new values for misssing data from existing value by using formulas.

The data has been acquired from superdatascience.com/course-advanced.
